Data Source
This project was created using data that was shared by Mobius through Kaggle under a CC0: Public domain license. These datasets were generated by Amazon Mechanical Turk based respondents during the period of 03.12.2016 - 05.12.2016. This data set contains personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring for 30 users. The files are in csv format and include files for wide data and minute data for minute vise tracking.
We will start by importing the necessary libraries and importing the data. The data imported will be stored in the variables for analysis.

We will see the summary of the dataset imported to gain some insights.
head(dailyActivity)
head(hourlyCalorie)
head(hourlyIntensities)
head(sleepDay)
Next data wrangling was performed. The software used for data wrangling was Google Sheets. Date and Time from the records were stored on separate columns by their respsective types so that they can be used further in analysis.
The same can also be performed by the lubridate package of R.

The summary shows that the average steps taken by users is 7638 which is less than the average recommended steps.
Sedentary Minutes is 991 which is 16 hours.
The majority of participants are lightly active.
Participants sleep 1 time in 7 hours
Merging Data
Now the datasets are merged so that visualization can be performed. dailyActivity and sleepDay is merged using Inner Join on columns Id and date.
merged_data <- merge(sleepDay, dailyActivity, by=c('Id', 'date'))

ggplot(data=dailyActivity, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(title="Total Steps vs. Calories")
## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

Here, we see a positive correlation which is obvious - more steps taken = more calories burned
ggplot(data=sleepDay, aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=TotalTimeInBed)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(title="Total Minutes Asleep vs. Total Time In Bed")
## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

We see the gap between Total Minutes Asleep and Total Time In Bed is significant and appropriate changes can be made.
intensity <- hourlyIntensities %>%
  group_by(Time) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  summarise(mean_total_int = mean(TotalIntensity))


ggplot(data=intensity, aes(x=Time, y=mean_total_int)) + geom_histogram(stat = "identity", fill='darkblue') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +

Here, users are more active in the evening than in morning of afternoon.
ggplot(data = merged_data, aes(x = TotalMinutesAsleep, y = SedentaryMinutes)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(title = "Total Minutes Asleep vs Sedentary Minutes")
## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

We see negative relationship between the two. Bellabeat app can recommend reducing sedentary time.
These are some insights that were captued.
Thank You!
